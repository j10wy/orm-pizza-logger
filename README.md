# :pizza: Logger
A pizza logging app following the MVC design pattern using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a custom ORM.

[Check out this video of the app for a run-through of how it works](pizza_demo.mp4).

## Next Steps

#### Model setup

* Also inside `pizza.js`, create the code that will call the ORM functions using pizza specific input for the ORM.

* Export at the end of the `pizza.js` file.

#### View setup

* Setup the `main.handlebars` file so it's able to be used by Handlebars.

* Setup the `index.handlebars` to have the template that Handlebars can render onto.

* Create a button in `index.handlebars` that will submit the user input into the database.
